NL4Py
===========

A Python controller interface to `NetLogo <https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/>`. NL4Py uses a client-server architecture, allowing Python client code to control NetLogo workspaces on a controller server. NL4Py supports controlling multiple workspaces through a single Python client.

At the moment, only HeadlessWorkspaces are supported.

NL4Py is based off of David Masad's Py2NetLogo.
